            <p>"When you light a candle, you also cast a Shadow"- Ursula K. Le Guin

                Suzzanah Winters does not know what to expect when she first lands in Dublin with her mate and comrades. 
                
                In a quest to retrieve not one but TWO important people, she knows that they must be prepared to face the worst. 
                
                Especially given her very curious abilities which keep getting 'curiouser and curiouser'.
                
                New place, new people, new mysteries...and old enemies...
                
                They're all thrown together in what could prove to be one heck of an adventure. 
                
                A deadly adventure. 
                
                And they must be ready... 
                
                Step, yet again, into a forbidden world filled with mysterious beings and haunting secrets, as the people we have grown to both love and hate, come alive to rule our minds once more. 
                
                With danger lurking about every corner and shadows rising all around, plunge into a realm where the Sun and Moon shall finally come face to face.
                
                And let the chaos begin again.
                
                A tale eclipsed from the start, of righteous men with Shadowed Hearts! </p>

            <p>Stay in your limits. Don't think that I don't know anything. I cannot forget what you and your mother did to me and with my sister. Be there where you are." He said and I held the wall to stop myself from falling.

                "One more thing,never again do it. Never touch my things again."He said and a tear escaped from my eyes to roll down on my cheek
                
                He went out of the room,leaving me all alone,with so much hurt. He shut the door so hardly that I jumped on my place. Tears were rolling down on my cheeks. I sat down on the floor. I was remembering each and every word he said today. All in these days, I had a hope that one he'll be mine but today he just broke everything.
                
                Stay in your limits.
                
                I cannot forget what you and your mother did to me and my sister.
                
                Be there where you are.
                
                His words were ringing in my ear,telling me who I'm to him. He thought I was behind all this. He thought that I was with my mother,compelling him to marry me. But he was wrong. I wanted to tell him. Words seems to lost for me.
                
                He said never touch his things."His things?" We are separate ??
                
                I thought, I am his wife and he know that I have the right on his everything but today he just told me my limits.</p>
